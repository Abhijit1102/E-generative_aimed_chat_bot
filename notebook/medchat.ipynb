      "Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as a\n",
      "source of respiratory disease more than 300 years ago,byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational haz-ard for textile workers for less than 50 years. More than800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-makingindustries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti-cles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills thatmanufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant riskof dying of this disease.\n",
      "In the United States, byssinosis is almost completely\n",
      "limited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. Morethan 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi-nosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of thepeople whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in thetextile-producing regions of North and South Carolina.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Wheezing ,shortness of breath , and a feeling of\n",
      "tightness in the chest occur occasionally during the earlystages of the disease. Symptoms are usually more pro-nounced when returning to work after a weekend, holi-day, or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reac-customed to the environment.\n",
      "As many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have\n",
      "symptoms that continue or recur throughout the work-week. More severe breathing problems seem to resultboth from exposure to high levels of dust and fromlonger dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettessuffer the most severe impairment.Diagnosis\n",

      "(drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve airflow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form.Reducing exposure is essential. Any worker who hassymptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathingshould transfer to a less-contaminated area.\n",
